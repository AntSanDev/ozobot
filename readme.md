# Reverse Engineering the [Ozobot](http://ozobot.com)

This is a pretty cool little line-follower. They publish the ["Static Codes", but not the "Flash Codes"](http://ozobot.com/play/color-code-language) which are used with [OzoBlockly](http://ozoblockly.com/). There is no SDK. So, I must resort to reverse engineering. :)
